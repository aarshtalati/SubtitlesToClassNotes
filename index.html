<p>Converts standard subtitle files for each chapter of each lesson into a single text file</p>

<p>So, I was looking at some online course, which come with subtitles. The website had a straighforward way to download the course video files and subtitle files (*.srt).</p>

<p>I noticed that ...</p>

<ol>
<li>I was spending too much time in just typing what was being spoken to take my notes so now I can simply copy-paste </li>
<li>Sometimes had to shuffle to multiple videos if I was looking for something in particular to refresh my memory so now I can open the text file and simply search to pin point the corresponding video clip in the course videos</li>
</ol>

<p>Another positive side effect is it let's the student set the offsets of subtitles ( I actually, developed this capability to fine tune a French movie I was  watching and the only English subtitle were little off from what was being spoken )</p>

<h2>
<a id="assumption" class="anchor" href="#assumption" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assumption</h2>

<p>The srt file follows the standard format.</p>

<a id="using-on-mac" class="anchor" href="#using-on-mac" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using on Mac</h2>

<p>I do not have a Mac to test with but I noted that the default .gitignore actually adds DNX related files to exception list.On the flip side, when I was going through <strong><em><a href="https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/vnext/how-to-build-c-sharp-on-mac-osx/">a great post,( you might want to skip to ยง 4 )</a></em></strong> I noticed the Project.json ( which is what you might be looking for ) but looks like it's needed for ASP.NET application (ASP.NET is a platform in .NET for writing Web Applications) not the stand-alone C# console application which runs on desktop computer - but I could be wrong. ( The crossed out links below are related to ASP.NET )</p>

<p>I'd honestly try to make arrangements to see if I can manage to test this app on Mac - but not in the position to be able to promise you. I did some research and following links seemed helpful :</p>
