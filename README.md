##Mac##

I do not have a Mac to test with but I noted that the default .gitignore actually adds DNX related files to exception list.On the flip side, when I was going through https://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/vnext/how-to-build-c-sharp-on-mac-osx/ (*great post, you might want to skip to ยง 4*) I noticed the Project.json ( which is what you might be looking for ) but looks like it's needed for ASP.NET application (ASP.NET is a platform in .NET for writing Web Applications) not the stand-alone C# console application which runs on desktop computer - but I could be wrong. ( The crossed out links below are related to ASP.NET )


I'd honestly try to make arrangements to see if I can manage to test this app on Mac - but not in the position to be able to promise you. I did some research and following links seemed helpful :

I'm planning to make it easier by building a [Docker](http://www.docker.com/ "Docker Homepage") container to make it easier for y'all.
